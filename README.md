# Introduction and Disclaimer

This guide is collective advice gathered from the computer science students at Gonzaga University. It should not be considered "professional" advice.

### TLDR

1. Apply early. August and September for Summer internships.
2. Prep for code challenges.
3. Apply to way more companies than you think is necessary. Over 30.


# Building your Technical Profile

Your technical profile consists of 4 basic things:
1. Skills and abilities (programming languages, libraries, tools)
2. Experience (jobs or internships that you've had)
3. Projects
4. GPA and classes

Each of these generally have their own section on a resume, typically as:
- Skills Section
- Experience Section
- Projects Section
- Education Section

**Side note**: If you have a GPA lower than 3.0, don't put it on your resume. If they ask about it, don't lie. Many companies don't care about your GPA and it frequently does not mean you are a poor engineer.

## Side Projects

For many people, classes alone are probably not enough to get the type of job you want. Having experience through side projects or jobs shows initiative and lets employers know that you can learn on your own.

## How to put a side project on a resume

If you have room, it's common to put side projects under a "projects" section in your resume. Include:
1. The language and libraries you used.
2. Some metric to show the size of the project (time taken to complete, user statistics, lines of code, ect)

An example side project on a resume might look like:

```
# Projects

## Doohicky.io [Summer, 2016]
- Built with Node.js and React.
- Hosted on AWS.
```

## How to get started with side projects

For most, this generally comes down to finding something you're interested in and trying to build it. However, when I first started building things, I had a lot of difficulty just figuring out how to get started. Here's what I recommend:

1. Get a team. Other people will keep you motivated as long as you keep them motivated. It basically creates social pressure to continue.
2. Build a game, an app, or a web app. There are sooooooooo many tutorials, docs and libraries in almost every language for these, so it's crazy easy to get into.
3. Find a tutorial to simply get something on your screen.
4. Set a very small goal for yourself, for example: "Move a block on the screen with the arrow keys", or "connect to a database".

# Finding Companies and Applying

Once you have built up your profile, you need to start applying for companies. If you go to a school that has little to no connections and has a minimal career fair, **you need to start applying to companies yourself.**

**General tips**
- APPLY EARLY. Apply in August and September if you can. Start searching for companies day 1 of school. Internships and new grad positions can go real quick.
- There are tons of good internship finders online. Some of the best are Linkedin, Internship.com, Indeed.com, Glassdoor.
- Apply for a large list of companies. Over 30. Do not set your sights on one company. Internships are competitive and it's not uncommon to send out 30 applications and only hear back from 1. This doesn't mean you're a bad dev, it can mean they've been hit with literally thousands of applications and can't easily sort through them.
- Apply for companies even if you don't have everything. Very few people generally do. And it can't hurt.
- Expand your radius. Don't apply to companies only in your home town. Even if you think you would never want to go to Boston or whatever, having another offer can vastly increase your ability to negotiate and you may end up getting a really good deal.
- Visit companies in person if you can. This is pretty cheesy, but showing up with your resume (and a box of donuts) can get you noticed and passed screens.
- Use contacts. Does your brother's ex-girlfriend know someone at XYZ company? Reach out.
- Contact a recruiter from the company directly on Linkedin.

## Lists of companies

- [Intern Supply](http://www.intern.supply/index.html), a list of companies with internships that are currently open.
- Hacker News has a "who's hiring" post every year that you can search through. Search `HN Who's Hiring [month] [year]` on google to find a recent post.
- [Breakoutlist](https://breakoutlist.com) has a list of companies that are currently experiencing large growth (and therefor will probably have more positions open)
- [Worried about whiteboarding? Checkout this list of companies that hire without whiteboards](https://github.com/poteto/hiring-without-whiteboards)
- [Wealthfront's 2017 Career-launching Companies](https://blog.wealthfront.com/2017-career-launching-companies-list/)

## Reaching out to people

You can always reach out to people at certain companies. Don't got connections? Does GU not provide any help for 99.9% of the companies you're interested in?

Find people on linkedIN. Make sure that you're looking for a University Recruiter if you're looking at a big company. Want to contact a university recruiter at XYZ Company?

Type this:
```
site:linkedin.com (inurl:in OR inurl:pub) -inurl:dir -inurl:job -inurl:jobs -inurl:jobs2 -intitle:profiles -inurl:groups "University Recruiter at <COMPANY>"
```

Into google and replace `<Company>` with your company you're interested in.

Send people messages on Twitter.

### Taking advantage of where you live.

Are you from a big city? Don't got a job over the summer? Go on meetup.com.

There's lots of CS related meetups for various tech. This is a fantastic way to network and can really help you find people in your area who might be able to introduce you to a hiring manager.

# Interviews

There are three types of "interviews" that you might experience:

1. Online code challenges
2. Technical Interviews
3. Behavioral Interviews

The career center should be able to give you lots of advice on behavioral interviews.
However, the vast majority of your interview experience will be code challenges and technical interviews.

#### Online code challenges
These are typically timed algorithm and data structure challenges.

#### Technical Interviews
These can be short interviews with an engineer or day-long interviews on campus.
They can cover a variety of topics, but are often very similar to the online-code challenges.

Tips for in-person technical interviews:
* Start simple: start with the brute force solution and then move on to more optimized solutions. It buys you time and ensures that you got at least something right.
* Narrate your thought process: explain what you are thinking and why you are making the choices you are making. It will make you seem thoughtful and thorough and fills the awkward silence gaps.

#### Behavioral Interviews
These are usually 30 min to an hour with an HR person.
They'll ask you questions like "Describe a time you failed. What did you learn?" or "What is a project you are really proud of?". The key here is to realize that every question is merely a different spin on **why should we hire you?**

A nice general format to answer these questions is like such:
1. Tell the story: not too much detail, just enough, usually 30 sec to 1 min.
2. **Explain how this experience will help this company:** This is really what you want to get to. ("Through this challenge, I learned how to use online resources to solve problems, and this will make me a more effective employee because I can independently figure things out and you don't need anyone to hold my hand.")

Tips:
* Develop a repitoire of go-to stories or experiences that reflect positively on what you have to offer. In the moment it will be hard to think of a good story.
* Don't tell the same story for multiple questions or it will seem that you have only one good experience. Diversity shows you are experienced.

It's important to practice. Look up "20 common interview questions" on Google. Practice with a friend. Work on being concise, clear, and poised.  

## Practicing

Both the online code challenges and technical interviews typically give you a problem to solve and then ask you to write an algorithm to solve it. Many can be solved by recognizing a particular data structure or common algorithm.

**You need to practice these before you do them.** Start practicing before you get the
challenge. You can practice these through a number of websites, but here are our favorites:

1. [Hackerrank](https://www.hackerrank.com/)
2. [Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/)
3. [Codewars](https://www.codewars.com/)

## CS Concepts
Outside of algorithms and data structures, there are certain CS concepts that
an interview might ask about that you should have a solid understanding of.

#### Big O
Big O is the efficiency of an algorithm.
